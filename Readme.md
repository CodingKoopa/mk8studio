MK8 Thing: More to come soon. (ish)

This is not ready to be used by the general public, or anyone, really.

Contributing: Please refer to Dolphin's contributing document. I didn't have a solid coding style at the beginning of working on this, so feel free to correct any odd messy things. Namely, two big ones are changing this->memberVariable to m_member_variale, and thisIsAFunction() to ThisIsAFunction().

Credits to Dolphin for the coding style, Decaf for ADDRLib, StapleButter for some of the IO code, Exzap for texture help, and AboodXD for GTX Extractor and texture help.
